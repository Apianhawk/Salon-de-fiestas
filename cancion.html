<title> SOLIS SALVADOR DAVID. OTT Easy Life y Benee</title>
<head>
<p align=center>I'm late, sober, and my friends are all wasted</p>
<p align=center>I go home on my own with no friends that I came with</p>
<p align=center>But, oh, it's such a laugh, such a happy occasion</p>
<p align=center>I took a photograph and it turned out amazing</p>
<p align=center>I don't understand you</p>
<p align=center>'Cause you've got a face like a slapped fish</p>
<p align=center>Always in vain, but in vogue and on trend</p>
<p align=center>Sure hope you calm down in the end</p>
<p align=center>You're way too OTT, wish you'd go slowly</p>
<p align=center>I think you've had quite enoug</p>
<p align=center>Time to get back on the bus</p>
<p align=center>You ought to keep it low-key, you're too close to OD</p>
<p align=center>I only tell you out of love</p>
<p align=center>Just try to keep your head above water</p>
<p align=center>Been smoking far too much</p>
<p align=center>Friends told me, "You're hitting quite the low</p>
<p align=center>I think it's time to go"</p>
<p align=center>And I'm not one to talk, but I know when to stop</p>
<p align=center>Clearly you don't</p>
<p align=center>I'm dragging you home</p>
<p align=center>But you're way too OTT, wish you'd go slowly</p>
<p align=center>I think you've had quite enough</p>
<p align=center>Time to get back on the bus</p>
<p align=center>You ought to keep it low-key, you're too close to OD</p>
<p align=center>I only tell you out of love</p>
<p align=center>Just try to keep your head above water</head/</p>
